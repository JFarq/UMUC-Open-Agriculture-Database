Team Food CMSC495 Capstone Project
Introduction

Please note this a work in progress and may not be stable at all times

The Team Food project is a social networking site that is aimed at providing a place for food computer builders to share and discuss the plant growing recipes they have built. You can read more about what food computers are at MIT's site for their Open Agriculture initiative here.

**********************************************************************************

Basic Functionality

With the goal of creating a central place where food computer builders can meet and share recipe files and discuss them our app will support the following functionality.

Create and manage account
Make posts for discussions
Upload/download recipe (*.gro) files
Graphical viewing of recipe file contents
How to install and run

**********************************************************************************

To run this on a local machine you will need at least the following:

Ruby, at least version 2.2.1
Rails, at least version 4.1.6
Ubuntu, server edition, version 14.04.4
Once these prerequisites are installed you can clone into your local test environment using:

git clone https://github.com/smurphy333/UMUC-Open-Agriculture-Database.git

**********************************************************************************


What it is:
Open Agriculture is an Open Source Project started by the
MIT Media Lab OpenAg. The Open Agriculture Data base is a 
project intended to enhance that vision, by allowing open 
sharing of plant recipies between the community Team Food.
